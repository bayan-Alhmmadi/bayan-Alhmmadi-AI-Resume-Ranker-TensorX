##  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. spaCy Model Not Found
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

2. NLTK Data Missing
The system automatically downloads required NLTK data on first run.

3. Memory Issues with Large Datasets
- Reduce batch size in `flask_backend.py`
- Increase system RAM
- Process files in smaller batches

4. File Upload Errors
- Check file format (PDF/DOCX only)
- Verify file size (max 1GB)
- Ensure files are not corrupted

### Performance Tips
- Use SSD storage for faster file processing
- Allocate at least 4GB RAM for large datasets
- Close other applications to free up memory
- Use batch processing for 100+ resumes
